Swap! is an endless runner where you "swap" colors to match the platform.
# Objective
The goal of the game is to travel the farthest without losing. A ball rolls on a platform automatically, and you lose when the ball becomes the opposite color of the ground. To change to the right color, you must click the "Swap!" button.

Your points raise depending on how long you last. The speed of the ball will also increase over time. The more points you gain, the more items in the store you can buy.

Try to last as long as possible in the color changing world.
