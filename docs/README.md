Swap! is an endless runner where you "swap" colors to match the platform.
# Objective
A ball rolls on a platform until it's the opposite color of the ground. The goal of the game is to travel the farthest without stopping. To change to the correct color, click the "Swap!" button.

Points increase depending on how far the ball travels. The speed of the ball will also increase over time. Buy items like songs and colors in the shop using points.

Try to last as long as possible in the color changing world.
